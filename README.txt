To replicate the analysis, run `get_batch_files.r` in the `scripts` folder. This generates configuration files to run many simulations in a job array.

Then run `run_simulation.sh`. Change batch_perc0.conf to a different file generated by `get_batch_files.r` to run different simulations. Simulations are set to save in a `output_data` folder.

To regenerate figures, run the respective script in the `figures_code` folder. Plots will save in the `output_plots` folder.
